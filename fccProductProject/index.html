    <h1 id="title">Doge Vibraphones</h1>

    <p class="about"><strong>About Doge Vibraphones...</strong> Doge Vibraphones was created by a Percussion Performance major named Andrea Godoshian. 
        Despite her love for the craft, she is a terrible musician & gets bullied every time she walks on stage.</p>
    <p class="about">Pity party aside! It seems like Andrea has pulled herself together & found a place for herself in the Tech industry... 
        however, the Tech industry <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">(freeCodeCamp specifically)</a> 
        wants her to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page" target="_blank">
            create a Product Landing page!</a> 
        Since Andrea is not very creative, took a page out of freeCodeCamp's book & decided to make a 
        <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL" target="_blank">"product landing page" for instruments.</a> However, as Andrea began creating this page,
        she was flooded with flashbacks about her terrible experiences as a musician... which is why Andrea turned this into a meme ðŸ¤£ðŸ’€</p>

    <h1 id="vibraphone">What is a Vibraphone?</h1>

    <p class="about">According to Britannica online (because again, I am not very creative), a Vibraphone is a 
        "...percussion instrument that has tuned metal bars and is similar in shape to a xylophone. 
        Felt or wool beaters are used to strike the bars, giving a soft, mellow tone quality. 
        Suspended vertically below each aluminum bar is a tubular, tuned resonator that sustains the tone when the bar is struck."</p>

    <p class="about">Do you hold a grude against Andrea for ruining your drumline experience? 
        Or... maybe, for some odd reason, you actually want to buy one of these monstrosities! 
        Just let me know. Because as my coach told me (right before a big performance): I am a black hole. 
        So whatever you send me will just be destroyed & therefore doesn't matter!</p>
