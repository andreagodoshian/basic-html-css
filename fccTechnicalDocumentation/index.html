                    According to IBM: "Java is a widely used object-oriented 
                    programming language and software platform that runs on billions 
                    of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, 
                    gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. 
                    The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.
                    One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. 
                    Once you have written code for a Java program on a notebook computer, 
                    it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device."

                    James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems initiated the Java language project 1991. 
                    Although their initial goal was creating a better television experience, 
                    they quickly surpassed that. The team initially called their new language Oak. 
                    However, when they went to register the name in 1995, they found out that "Oak" was
                    already taken. They eventually settled on the name "Java" (yes, they were just 
                    making a coffee reference).
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    The Official Java Development Kit 1.0 was released in 1996.
                    In less than ten years (2004), Java was running on over one billion devices.
                    And by 2008, Java was running on over five billion devices!
                    Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the multinational computer technology corporation 
                    known as Oracle aquired Sun in 2009. Fast-forward to today (2022): 
                    Java is still one of the top programming languages for developers & shows no signs of slowing down.

                    Primitive Data Types

                <p class="section-text">
                    According to the current Oracle documentation: "The Java programming language is statically-typed, 
                    which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used. 
                    This involves stating the variable's type and name (...):
                    <code>int gear = 1;</code>
                    Doing so tells your program that a field named 'gear' exists, 
                    holds numerical data, and has an initial value of '1' (...).
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">In addition to int, the Java programming language 
                    supports seven other primitive data types. A primitive type is 
                    predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword. 
                    Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. 
                    The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:
                    <ul id="primitive-chart">
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">byte:</span> The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. 
                            It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive)...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">short:</span> The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. 
                            It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive)...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">int:</span> By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, 
                            which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">long:</span> The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. 
                            The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">float:</span> The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. 
                            Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the 
                            Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">double:</span> The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. 
                            Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the 
                            Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification...

                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">boolean:</span> The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. 
                            Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. This data type 
                            represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely defined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class = "key">char:</span> The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value 
                            of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).

                <p class="section-text">
                    Non-Primitive data types (also called <strong>Relative Data Types</strong>) are difficult to explain, 
                    unless you have a basic understanding of programming
                    (completing "30 Days Of Code" in any language should be enough). 
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">One reason they are difficult for absolute beginners to understand, is because Non-Primitive data is created by the programmer!
                    And since they are created by the programmer, they need to reference a memory location (which is why they're also called 
                    “reference variables”). Examples of non-primitive types include Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Let's take a look at how to create two of the most popular Reference Variables: Strings and Arrays!

                        String myString = "Hello World!";
                    </code>

            <p class="section-text">"Hello World" is a famous computer program which can easily be applied
                to almost any language. For many programmers, "Hello World" is the first program that they write.
                The goal of "Hello World" is to explain the core structure & test if your software
                is working, by simply diplaying the words "Hello World" on the screen.

                Although installing Java, choosing an IDE, etc. is outside the scope of this discussion, here is a
                breakdown of how "Hello World" works in Java from GeeksForGeeks:

                        This line uses the keyword class to declare that a new class is being defined. 
                        It [also has] an identifier that is the name of the class. The entire class definition, 
                        including all of its members, will be between the opening curly brace { and the closing curly brace }.

                        In the Java programming language, every application must contain a main method whose signature is:
